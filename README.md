# grocery-delivery-application

A grocery shopping is an android application where users can purchase and order groceries online. The system is developed with a user-friendly and attractive GUI. It delivers a wide range of groceries available online. Users have to first login into the system to view the groceries and add them into their cart. They can then order it by making a secure online payment via CREDIT CARD. The system functionality of products and orders is stored on server side in a web service. The android app is for client usage. It consists of client side scripting for placing orders by connecting to the server side webservice.
For a grocery app to function correctly, it needs to contain these features.

• Register/Login
The user needs to be able to register themselves in the app with their information.

• User Profile Management
The user will need a profile where they can find all of their saved orders. This is beneficial for both convenience and accuracy purposes. The orders are easier to find because they're stored in one place, but it also benefits businesses by ensuring that what was ordered isn't lost or forgotten about.

• Product Search Features
There must be some search tool within the grocery delivery mobile application so people can look up different types of products based on desired criteria such as name, brand, ingredients used, etc. This helps save time while shopping since customers don't have to read every label before buying something. Furthermore, this feature can also play a role in getting rid of products that are about to go wrong and encouraging customers to purchase something before it's too late.

• Geo-Location Services
Grocery delivery mobile applications can use the GPS feature on a customer's phone to simplify their shopping experience. For example, if someone is looking for an item they know is located within the next aisle over, instead of having to walk all the way there and back again or ask somebody where it might be, which would take up even more time than just walking to get it.

This also reduces frustration since customers don't have to spend half of their grocery trip finding one particular product.

• Mobile Alerts
In addition to the GPS feature, grocery delivery mobile applications can also send out alerts for users that will save them from searching through aisles of products.

For example, if someone knows they need something within a particular aisle but it has been days since their last trip and they have forgotten which aisle it is located in; the app may remind them with an alert, so new customers don't have to go searching aimlessly throughout the store for a product.

• Added To Cart
In addition to sending alerts, another feature that grocery delivery mobile applications can include is the ability for a customer to add items to their cart.

This way, customers won't have to search through every aisle to find all of the products they need and then remember where it was located – there will already be a list waiting for them when they get home.

• Integration Of Payment Gateways
Along with the alerts and cart features, grocery delivery apps should also integrate various payment gateways.

This way, customers can pay for their groceries through an app that streamlines the entire process – there won't be any need to go digging around in pockets or bags looking for cash or cards.

• E-Wallet Integration
This feature is a must-have for those who like using digital wallets such as Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and PayPal wallet!

Grocery delivery mobile applications that support e-wallet integration make it even more straightforward than ever to buy groceries online and get them delivered straight to your doorstep within hours of ordering.

• Organizing The Order for Distribution And Tracking
An app might also allow customers to organised their orders for distribution and delivery.

• Discount Vouchers and Coupons
Customers could also get discount vouchers or coupons for future orders.

• Ratings And Reviews
After you deliver groceries, it's always great to ask the customer if they were satisfied with your service. This feature enables customers to rate their experience and leave a review on how well (or not so well) the delivery was handled by the grocery mobile app company.
